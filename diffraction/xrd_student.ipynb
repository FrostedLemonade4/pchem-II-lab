    "We don't observe diffraction in a crystal by light passing through gaps between atoms. Rather, we diffraction occurs in a crystal when light scatters off atoms. \n",
    "\n",
    "As with diffraction through a grating, we only need to consider light rays that travel parallel to one another for each angle. When we do this, we can treat the problem as involving _reflection_ instead of scattering.\n",

    "To understand how diffraction works, we first need to understand the interference of light reflecting off two nearby points.\n",

    "This $\\theta$ has a slightly different meaning here. Notice also a new factor of two. As you explore diffraction through a lattice, pay close attention to definition of $\\theta$ and try to deduce where the factor of two comes from."

    "## Part 4 - Characteristic Absences and Interpreting XRD Spectra\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving deeper, let's clarify the distinction between powder and single-crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD). single-crystal XRD diffraction patterns are direction-dependent, varying with the X-ray beam's orientation relative to the crystal. The technique of powder XRD, however, involves shining the beam through many differently oriented samples of a crystal, resulting in an orientation-independent spectrum. Here, any set of mirror planes that produces constructive interference appears as concentric rings, with their angle from the center equal to $2\\theta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Earlier, we examined mirror planes in a Face Centered Cubic (FCC) lattice, and their associated d and $2\\theta$ values. You might expect that the XRD spectrum of this crystal would show peaks for every $2\\theta$ value corresponding to the different combinations of $h$, $k$, and $l$. However, this is not the case.\n",
    "\n",
    "We observe _selection rules_ based on the symmetries present in each crystal. For different types of lattices, certain peaks corresponding to different sets of $h$, $k$, and $l$ values will be present or absent. For example:\n",
    "* __Simple cubic__: Peaks will be observed for all combinations of $h$, $k$, and $l$.\n",
    "* __Face-centered cubic__: $h$, $k$, and $l$ must be either all even or all odd for a peak to be observed.\n",
    "* __Body-centered cubic__: The sum $h + k + l$ must be even for a peak to be observed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, by indexing the peaks on our spectrum by their $h$, $k$, and $l$ values, we gain insight not only into the interplanar spacings but also the crystal's symmetry."
